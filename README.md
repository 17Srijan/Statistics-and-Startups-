# Statistics-and-Startups
## Description
The dataset encompasses startups from around the world. In this analysis, we focused on Indian startups, examining both the average funds raised and the number of funding rounds they underwent. We were looking at startups that are either operating and those that are closed.
## Objective
To perform statistical tests to understand:
- if there is a statistically significant difference in the **mean funds** raised between startups that are **operating** and those that are **closed** by using an independent sample t-test.
- If there is a statistically significant difference in the **funding rounds** between **operating** and **closed** startups by using the chi-square test of independence.
## Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Filtered Data based on Country because had to analyze Indian Startups data.
- For simplicity restricted the status category for closing and operating startups.
- Removed data where the amount of funding was missing.
- Created Funding round categories of **1,2 and 3+** as the majority of data was between 1,2 and 3 rounds.
## Analysis and Insights
1. Total Data for startups after performing the cleaning operation was around 1134 Startups, of which 1085 were currently operating and 49 had ceased operations.
2. Startups that went through just 1 round of funding were 795, 2 rounds were 205 and 3+ were 134.
3. the P-value in both tests was above the significance level of 0.05.
4. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean funds raised between startups that are operating and those that are closed.
5. There was no statistically significant difference in the funding rounds between operating and closed startups.
